  - Contains notebooks with complete strategy implementations (e.g., `3EMA_MACDV_AROON.ipynb`)
  - These notebooks define the logic and parameters for each strategy
  
- **`analysis/`** - Research and parameter derivation notebooks
  - Contains notebooks for:
    - Parameter optimization
    - Backtest analysis
    - Strategy comparison
    - Market research and exploration
